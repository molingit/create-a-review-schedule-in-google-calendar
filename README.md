# create-a-review-schedule-in-google-calendar
Here is a script and a spreadsheet to automatically add review dates to the google calendar.

For example, let's say you learned programming "lesson 3" today.
Then, open a spreadsheet, write "Lesson 3" in the "today's your task" field, and click the "Add Review Schedule Button" to fill in the review schedule in your google calendar.

review schedule will be something like this
today
1 day later
7 days later
21 days later
49 days later


<<Procedure>>
-- Upload the excel file to google spreadsheet.
-- Open the spreadsheet and paste the code into the script.
-- Link the script to the button in the spreadsheet.
-- If you want to use the delete function, substitute your gmail address in the code.
-- When you run the script for the first time, there will be a security check from google.

  ** We assume that you can use google spreadsheets and scripts.
